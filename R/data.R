#' Kaggle Chess Players (2010)
#'
#' A directed, signed network (edgelist) among chess players (nodes) giving
#' the chess match outcomes (edges), for game-by-game results among the
#' world's top chess players. The direction of edge (i,j) denotes white
#' player (i) and black player (j). Each edge is timestamped (approximate).
#' Edge sign is +1 for a win by white, 0 for draw, and -1 for a win by black.
#' The dataset is anonymous: the identity of the players in unknown and
#' timestamps are approximate.

#' Seed-disperser web (1988)
#'
#' A bipartite network of bird and plant interactions. Data was recorded
#' by counting number of visits of each bird species to each plant species.
#' The original data format (interaction frequency matrix) has been
#' converted to an edgelist of interaction counts.
#'
#' Of note, pairs with zero interactions have been omitted. As a result, a
#' small subset of birds and plants that were in the original matrix are
#' not present in this dataset (i.e. birds that did not interact with any
#' plants and vice versa). Additionally, only the common names of the bird
#' and plant species are included. For the scientific names (genus and
#' species), please see the original data source (link below).
