\description{
A directed, signed network (edgelist) among chess players (nodes) giving
the chess match outcomes (edges), for game-by-game results among the
world's top chess players. The direction of edge (i,j) denotes white
player (i) and black player (j). Each edge is timestamped (approximate).
Edge sign is +1 for a win by white, 0 for draw, and -1 for a win by black.
The dataset is anonymous: the identity of the players in unknown and
timestamps are approximate.
